### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist with a passion for technology.

I currently develop projects that prioritize solving business problems, from understanding them, analyzing data, to extracting insights and implementing the solution. I also continue to develop myself with improvement and study activities such as a portfolio of data science projects and I also write about the same topic on a blog on Medium.

For more details about my projects and each solution, they are described in the data science project section.
